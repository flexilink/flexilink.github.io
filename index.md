## **FlexiLink: A Deterministic Non-IP Network for Critical Infrastructure**

### **About the Project**

FlexiLink is a next-generation deterministic networking architecture. It is designed as a **non-IP, ultra-low-latency, time‑deterministic backbone** for future communication systems, including:

* Energy networks & smart grid
* Industrial control & automation
* Telecom backbone (5G / 6G)
* Live media, AV, and real-time computing
* Critical national infrastructure

The technology has been put forward to the **ETSI Non‑IP Networking (NIN)** initiative, whose working group is chaired by **John Grant**.

## **Key Features**

* **Latency as low as 65μs** for high‑resolution audio
* **Guaranteed delivery** for time‑critical flows
* **Up to 97.6% bandwidth utilisation**
* **Hardware‑proven prototype (Aubergine)**
* **Non‑IP design reduces the attack surface significantly**
* **Compatible with SDN‑style control and slicing**
* **Runs over existing fibre / IP infrastructure when required**

## **Project Documentation**

Initial documentation will be added gradually. This section will expand as individual components are prepared.

Planned documents include:

* Architecture overview
* Core technology
* Cloud lab environment
* Publications & patents

---

## **Hardware Prototypes**

FlexiLink has been implemented in FPGA as the **Aubergine switch**, featuring:

* Deterministic switching fabric
* Custom soft CPU
* Hardware scheduling
* Real‑time audio/video routing with deterministic latency

## **Standards & Collaboration**

FlexiLink contributes to international standardisation:

* **ETSI NIN (Non‑IP Networking)**
* **AES / IEC 62379**
* **Secured time‑critical networking research (Birmingham City University)**

Collaboration enquiries are welcome from regulators, telecom operators, energy companies, and research institutions.
